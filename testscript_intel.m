% This script demonstrates the usage of the functions to estimate the
% intelligibility of speech-in-noise conditions. The script reads two
% wavefiles; the first one (man's voice) is the target signal and the
% second one (woman's voice) is the interfering speaker. To contrast the 
% effects of an interference speaker (non-stationary noise) with a white
% noise inference (stationary noise/constant power) a white noise signal
% is also used. These signals are then scaled (varying SNR) to illustrate 
% Good intelligibility (~.6), barely intelligible (~.2), and unintelligible
% (.1).
% 
% The output of the script plots the Speech intelligibility Index for 100 ms
% windows over the speech signal, and displays the computed mean and standard
% deviation of SII (for active speech, silence intervals were excluded).
% Users can change the envelope threshold which is used to remove the
% silence intervals so the mean SII is not as dependent on pauses between
% words (if speech is not active intelligibility is low as expected). They
% can also change the length of the overlaping time window which is used
% to window the signals while estimating the SII.  The scaled target
% signal together with the interfering signal(noise) is played for reference
% purpose.
